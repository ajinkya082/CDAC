/*pure virtual function
In this the base class will not carry any code but 
just a compulsion that any class inheriting this must 
implement this function. 
A class which has one or more virtual methods is also called an abstract class. 
This class is used just as a framework so that somebody can follow the framework and implement it in their own way.
